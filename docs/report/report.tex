\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.
\usepackage{hyperref}





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{The Problem Statement}
Spreadsheets are an integral part of our lives. Whether it comes to creating
timetables, bookkeeping possessions or tabulating marks, it is difficult to
imagine life without spreadsheets. Unfortunately, most popular spreadsheet
softwares like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are \emph{What You See Is What
You Get} (WYSIWYG) editors. These softwares do not offer a very good programming
interface, which in most cases can automate jobs much faster. Many such
solutions are also paid for and not open source entirely. Further, the open
source softwares do not have the many features implemented, which makes them
unpopular. 

That's where Tabulate comes in. With high level programming constructs to
abstract the implementation of seemingly complex operations, Tabulate makes it
possible to \emph{program} your spreadsheet.

\subsection{Our Goals}
Tabulate aims to be the go-to Domain Specific Language (DSL) for those who
manage many spreadsheets in their everyday life. It aims to automate the tedious
process of repetitive entries, updates, and formulae with high performance and
efficiency. Built on top of C++, Tabulate aims to provide the programmer with
more control over their spreadsheet.

\section{Challenges Faced}
The authors faced the following challenges in various phases while building
\emph{Tabulate}.

\subsection{Symbol Table Implementation}
The symbol table in \emph{Tabulate} has been implemented using a template class
implementation. This enabled the authors to define different symbol tables for
symbol table records of various types. However, issues regarding declarations of
an identifier in various constructs (for example, declaration of a single
identifier as a variable and a struct) came up. Nested declarations also had to
be handled, for which a \texttt{C++ std::unordered\_map} with a \texttt{C++
std::stack} was used. Finally, since the symbol table class was a template
class, it could not be linked during compilation, and had to be implemented in
the same header file itself.

\subsection{Input/Output}
\emph{Tabulate} does not aim to be an interactive language. However, it must
take input in the form of CSV or similar files for processing. Only CSV file
input and output have been implemented by the authors given the time
constraints. Implementing other formats such as XLSX would have been a difficult
and tedious task requiring other open-source libraries.

\subsection{Dynamic Typing}
\emph{Tabulate} aims to be a user-friendly DSL rather than high-performing. Even
though high performance is important for such a software, it is imperative to
make the programming interface easy to use so that users who are not skilled
programmers can take advantage of the high performance offered by this language.
Therefore, the authors primarily focused on making this DSL easy to learn and
understand. One of the steps in that direction is \emph{dynamic typing}, which
prevents the user from worrying about static typing and casting, which is
handled by \emph{Tabulate}. While implementing dynamic typing, however, the
authors ran into a lot of issues involving pointers, as they were heavily used,
cast, and dereferenced. Further, many parts of the code required explicit
runtime checks before use, which would slow down the runtime of the final
compiled executable.

\section{Compilation Pipeline}
The compilation pipeline adopted by the authors is described in this section.

\subsection{Lexical Analysis}
The lexer for \emph{Tabulate} is implemented using \texttt{flex} in C++ mode. It
matches the character stream from the source code using regular expressions, and
reports a \emph{lexical error} in case the tokens are ill-formed. The lexical
analyser passes these tokens to the parser for syntax analysis using the
\texttt{yy} namespace functions implemented by the parser, which are described
in the next section.

\subsection{Syntax Analysis}
The parser for \emph{Tabulate} is implemented using \texttt{bison} in C++ mode.
In particular, the parser is LALR(1). The parser defines the tokens it expects
from the lexer, and sets the syntax rules that should be followed by
\emph{Tabulate}. As with most implementations using these tools, the parser
controls the lexer. Further, special options have been used to change how tokens
are input. These can be read about in the
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html}{\texttt{bison}
manual}.

\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
The semantic analyzer for \emph{Tabulate} is implemented in the parser file
itself. In particular, the parser implements an S-Attributed Translation Grammar
(SATG). Apart from the usual semantic actions for various checks in
\emph{Tabulate}, the authors have also implemented a \texttt{tabulate::driver}
interface to make the symbol table and other data structures for semantic
analysis to the parser, such as global counters and flags for performing
semantic checks specific to some constructs.

\subsection{Runtime Libraries}
Apart from compile-time semantic checks, \emph{Tabulate} also performs runtime
semantic checks since it implements dynamic typing. Examples of such checks
include struct member access, array out of bounds, and type checking and
coercion. Dynamic typing has been implemented using the \texttt{any} class
that uses pointer casting.

\subsection{Code Generation}
\emph{Tabulate} generates an equivalent C++ code for the instructions specified
in its own language. The semantic actions for such code generation are present
in the parser itself. Extra attributes for grammar non-terminals were introduced
for translation purposes. The code generation is linear and does not warrant a
second pass. Easier to use C++ filestream objects are used to output the
generated code.

\subsection{Compilation of Generated Code}
\emph{Tabulate} also compiles the generated C++ code using the GNU G++ compiler.
The code generated complies with the C++17 standard. Thus, by simply calling the
\emph{Tabulate} compiler, one can generate executable machine code without
having to compile the generated C++ code separately.

\section{Building and Running}
This section provides the reader with instructions to build \emph{Tabulate} from
source and run the compiler on any source code written in this DSL. These
instructions are also documented
\href{https://github.com/goats-9/cs3423-project/blob/main/README.md}{here} and
are present in \autoref{code:run}. These instructions must be run at a Linux
terminal window.

\begin{code}
\inputminted[linenos,breaklines,frame=single]{bash}{codes/run.sh}
\captionof{listing}{Instructions to Build and Run \emph{Tabulate}.}
\label{code:run}
\end{code}

These shell instructions show how to build and use the \texttt{CMake} project
present in the \texttt{codes} folder, with the output directory being
\texttt{codes/build}. The two binaries produced by this process are
\texttt{tabulate}, the compiler executable, and \texttt{libruntime.a}, a static
runtime library to translate and run the translated C++ code.
